Title: Market Analysis for International Expansion at La poule qui chante

Introduction:

Welcome to the international expansion project at La poule qui chante, a French agri-food company! In this project, your goal is to conduct a preliminary analysis of potential target countries for exporting poultry products. You'll have the freedom to choose the data analysis language (R or Python) and leverage data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to inform your analysis.

Project Overview:

The project entails the following key objectives:

Data Preparation and Exploration: Clean, prepare, and explore the FAO data to identify potential target countries for exporting poultry products.

Hierarchical Clustering: Implement hierarchical clustering to group countries based on relevant features and visualize the dendrogram.

K-Means Clustering: Apply the k-means clustering method to refine the analysis and compare results with hierarchical clustering. Analyze centroids and explore the clusters.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Conduct PCA to visualize the results of the clustering analysis, understand relationships between variables and countries.

Project Deliverables:

Your deliverables for this project include:

Notebook or R file containing data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.
Notebook or R file containing hierarchical and k-means clustering, along with visualizations.
Presentation summarizing the project context, methodology, results, and recommendations (maximum 20 slides).
Soutenance Structure:

During the oral presentation, your evaluator will assume the role of Patrick, your manager. The presentation should last approximately 15 minutes, followed by a discussion and debriefing session.

Evaluation Criteria:

Data Exploration: Ability to synthesize variables and explore data effectively to identify patterns.
Clustering Analysis: Proficiency in implementing hierarchical and k-means clustering methods and interpreting results.
Presentation Skills: Clear articulation of project context, methodology, findings, and recommendations in the presentation.
Conclusion:

Your role in this project is pivotal in guiding La poule qui chante's international expansion strategy. By conducting a thorough market analysis using data-driven approaches, you'll provide valuable insights to support decision-making regarding target countries for poultry exports. Best of luck with your analysis and presentation, and may your findings contribute to the company's success in the global market! üåçüêî
